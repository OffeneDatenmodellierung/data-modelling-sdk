# Cargo audit configuration
# This file allows specific advisories that are acceptable for this project

# Allow unmaintained warnings for transitive dependencies
# These are acceptable because:
# 1. They come from optional feature-gated dependencies (imageproc, datafusion)
# 2. They are unmaintained warnings, not security vulnerabilities
# 3. The crates are still functional and widely used

[advisories]
# custom_derive - transitive via imageproc (png-export feature)
# This is an unmaintained warning, not a security issue
allow = [
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0058",  # custom_derive unmaintained
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0436",  # paste unmaintained (via datafusion and imageproc)
    "RUSTSEC-2021-0140",  # rusttype unmaintained (via imageproc)
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0320",  # yaml-rust unmaintained (direct dependency)

# Only deny actual security vulnerabilities, not unmaintained warnings
